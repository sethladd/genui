# Flutter Coding Agent

A tool using GenKit to generate Flutter code using an agentic framework.

This repository contains a GenKit application that generates Flutter code based
on user requirements. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to design the
application's architecture, create an implementation plan, and generate the
corresponding Dart code.

See the agent [README.md](./agent/README.md) for information about running the
agent.
